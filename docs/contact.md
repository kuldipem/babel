The recommended way to report bug or make suggestions is the issue
tracker. If for some reason you can’t or don’t want to use it, you can
contact with the following form. 

I regret I don’t answer questions about how to use `babel` (or about
how to use TeX or LaTeX), which are best addressed to public forums,
like <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/">TeX Stack Exchange</a>
(which I read regularly).
