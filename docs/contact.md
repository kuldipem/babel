The recommended way to report bugs or make suggestions is the issue

contact the maintainer with the following form. 

We regret questions about how to use `babel` are not answered (or about
how to use TeX or LaTeX), which are best addressed to public forums,
like <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/">TeX Stack Exchange</a>.
