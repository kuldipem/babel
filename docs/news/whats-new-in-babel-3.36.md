2019-11-14

## Switching on and off global features

Sometimes you might need to disable some global `babel` features and the
macro `\babeladjust` has been added for this. For example, you can set
`\babeladjust{bidi.text=off}` if you are using an alternative algorithm
or with large sections not requiring bidi text.
