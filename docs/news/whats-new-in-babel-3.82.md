# What's new in babel 3.82

*Draft*

## Predefined tranforms with \babelprovide

Now transforms can be activated with a second `\babelprovide` (or after
a `provide=*`), so that the following code is valid:
```tex
\usepackage[kannada, provide=*]
\babelprovide[transforms = danda.nobreak]{kannada}
```
Formerly, the transform was ignored except if requested in the very
first call.

## Tibetan (xetex)

Some adjustements has been added to the ini file for Tibetan for it to
work with XeTeX. However, features like text padding with tshegs wonâ€™t
be available, because of the limitations of this engine.

## Fixes

* `babel` restored in part the old `\MakeUppercase` and
  `\MakeLowercase`, which meant macros like `\label` raised again an
  error. A new patch minimizes this side effect.
* Fix for #182 (error with Thai and XeTeX) was not complete.
