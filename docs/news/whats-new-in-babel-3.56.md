# What's new in babel 3.56

2021-03-24

The concept of ‘transform’ (requires `luatex`) is introduced, which
embraces `\babelprehyphenation` and `\babelposthyphenation` and it's
meant as a way to process the text at the typesetting level in several
language-dependent ways, like non-standard hyphenation, special line
breaking rules, script to script conversion, spacing conventions and so
on. They are conceptually similar to those in Unicode, but not the
same, because in `babel` they are focused on the typographical level.

Transforms have been available for more than a year, but in this
version they can be defined in `ini`files, too.

`luatex`](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/non-standard-hyphenation-with-luatex.html).

## Inserting spaces (with `luatex`)

Some languages require readjusting the space before or after some
characters (a well-known case is French). There is a new key to add a
space, with takes 3 numbers for the natural width, the `plus` and the
`minus` in em units. You may need to set where the quad value is taken
from with `data`:
```tex
\babelprehyphenation{french}{ «{a} }{
  {},
  { insert, penalty = 10000 }, 
  { insert, space= .2 .05 0, data = 1 },
  {}
}
\babelprehyphenation{french}{ «|{a} }{
  {},
  { insert, penalty = 10000 },
  { space= .2 .05 0, data = 1 },
  {}
}
```
Alternatively, the first one can be defined as follows if it comes
before the second declaration (because the pattern of the latter
then matches):
```tex
\babelprehyphenation{french}{ «{a} }{
  {},
  { insert, space= .2 .05 0, data = 1 },
  {}
}
```

An alternative, which is more useful in many cases, is `spacefactor`,
which takes 3 numbers, too, but they are factors to be applied to the
word separation in the font.
```tex
\babelprehyphenation{french}{ «{a} }{
  {}, 
  { insert, penalty = 10000 }, 
  { insert, spacefactor= .8 .3 .8, data = 1 },
  {}
}
```

As you can see, now multiple insertions are allowed, which is often
necessary when a space is added. (No direct relation to TeX
`\spacefactor`.)

In addition, the code has been refactored, to improve both stability
with overlapping patterns and speed. <del>There are still some issues to be
sorted out, like the behavior in verbatim mode.</del> [**Update.**
Fixed in 3.58.]

## Transforms in `ini` files

Based on the two macros above, `ini` files can define ‘transforms’.
```ini
[transforms.prehyphenation]
space.punctuation.1.0 = { «{a} }
space.punctuation.1.1 = {}
space.punctuation.1.2 = { insert, penalty = 10000 }
space.punctuation.1.3 = { insert, spacefactor=.8 .3 .8, data = 1 }
space.punctuation.1.4 = {}
```

`0` is the pattern. The replacements are `1`, `2`, etc. It must be
activated with `transforms` in `\babelprovide`, eg:

```tex
\babelprovide[transforms = space.punctuation, import]{...}
```

A single transform (with a single name) may consist in a collection of
rules (a typical case would be a transliteration scheme). Every rule in
the collection is numbered (the first `.1.` in the example). There can be even
rules in the two sections for transforms (`transforms.prehyphenation`
and `transforms.posthyphenation`); in such a case, restart with `1` in
the second section.

In future releases, several `ini` files will be expanded to take advantage
of this new feature.

## Arbitrary characters in patterns

The brace syntax has been extended to insert any character (for
example, `%`). Just write the hex code with at least 4 ‘hex digits’.
For example, `{d}{0025}` matches a digit followed by a `%`.

Remember you can still enter characters with the old good `^^` syntax,
which is converted at the TeX level; this `{}` extension is handled by
lua directly, so catcodes are not relevant.

## Fixes

* When writing the previous feature, some anomalous behavior when
  inserting items were detected, either with a multi-letter `string` or
  with `insert`. In these cases, `data` was somewhat unpredictable,
  too.
* Hyphen was not shown in Marathi (#123).
